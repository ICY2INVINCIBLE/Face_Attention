# DataSet
    路 val_1429:There are 1429 validation photos
    路 train_5358:There 5358 train photos
    路 test_1630:There 1630 test photos
    路 the name of photo like 3_150, the first one 3 is engagement, the second one 150 is the number which you can ignore. 

These photos are extracted one frame from each video and their resolution has been processed as 90*120. At the sametime, I have already extracted 10 frames from each video. Because gitbash only can upload the file small than 100M unless using git lfs and my Intrnet speeds are incredibly slow, therefore I give up downloading the gitlfs to upload these dataset. If you want to get, you can contact with me. 
**pay attention**
There are several incorrect photos haven't been processed.

# _CNN.py
**pay attention**
1.Tensorflow should lower than 2.
2.Line 198 and 199 change the path where your train and validation put. 
3.Line 153 change to your own path.

Good Night!
